"Correction for 2016 Prompt(80x) sample. 2.66/fb data is used. 
 Report for this version in Muon POG working meeting (July 13th, 2016). 
 The correction only contains the statistical uncertainty of the correction."

Downloaded rochcor80x_070616v2.tgz
tar -xvf rochcor80x_070616v2.tgz
Created Ntupliser/RochCor/ directory
Copied the following files:
  * RoccoR.cc
  * RoccoR.h
  * RoccoR_13tev.txt
  * rochcor2016.cc
  * rochcor2016.h

Copied BuildFile.xml from KaMuCa/Calibration/ (but commented-out most of it)

Moved .cc and .h files into src/ and interface/ directories, modified includes

Edited interface/RoccoR.h to make some constant parameters C++ compatible

Edited data/Feb06/config.txt to provide 200 toys for statistical uncertainty ... 
but there are only 100 files available in data/Feb06/, so that's the max available
